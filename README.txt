Implementation(MM-Algorithm is used) of the method of prediction of the results of tennis matches described in the article:
"Bradley-Terry type model for forecasting tennis match results (Int. J. of Forecasting, 2011, pp.
619-630, I. McHale, A. Morton)"

This algorithm is applied to the public datasets of the 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 years taken from
